Error: pre-commit not found on PATH.

Install via one of:
  pipx install pre-commit         # recommended (https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)
  brew install pre-commit         # macOS
  pip install --user pre-commit   # cross-platform

Docs: https://pre-commit.com/#install

After installation, re-run scripts/setup.sh

git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# Pre-populate hook environments so the first commit doesn't pay the
# install latency.
pre-commit install-hooks

cat <<'MSG'
Setup complete:
  - core.hooksPath = .githooks
  - hook environments cached for first commit

Hooks run on every commit (and gitleaks also on push), in this clone
and any of its worktrees. To bypass once (NOT recommended): commit
with --no-verify. To run hooks manually against the whole tree:
pre-commit run --all-files
